As with many words, also the term Fachschaft comes with more than one meaning: Technically, the term Fachschaft refers to the entire SfS student body. Colloquially, it is almost always used synonymously with Fachschaftsrat to refer to the group of student representatives. This is also how we generally use the term. Today we are talking to you in the role of these representatives.

The Fachschaft* Sprachwissenschaft is an association of students, open to all who study at the Seminar für Sprachwissenschaft (SfS) at the University of Tübingen, whether general or computational linguistics, or both. 

Our objectives are

to help each other: 
  - by sharing our experiences: precourse, all purpose tutorials, workshops
  - by mediating when there is an issue or conflict wiht a course and/or teacher
to organize events for getting to know each other:
  - regular's table, pub crawl, breakfast, Christmas party, movies' night, etc
to lobby for improvements in the course of studies and at the university:
  - as part of the Institutsbeirat, we have a say in personell and administrative decisions concerning the SfS

We can be contacted via e-mail, social media, by simply talking to one of us in person or by joining one of our meetings.

They currently take place every Friday at 5:00 PM at 049 Keplerstraße 2. If you're interested, just drop by.

Today, we will be meeting for start of the semster drinks at Schmitz Katze at 6:30pm.

We are looking forward to getting to know you :-)
