This is the meetings folder.

Files are titled year month date, for not really any particularly good reason other than I started writing them like that and I guess I will continue for consistency. It's also nice because sorting it alphabetically gets you the expected order or something. 

There is a [template you can use](template.md) to get you started on taking the meeting minutes (aka Protokoll if you want to speak Germanified English).
