Agenda:
- position of Fachschaft towards Gayas workshop
- setting up Fachschaft events which don't involve drinking 
- christmas party 

Meeting
Present: Bo, Gaya, Paula, John (Discord), Nicolai


1. Position of Fachschaft for Workshop of "Triangle of Life". 
As the Fachschaft shares the values to empower and support students, every idea should be given a try. 
That also counts for the workshop by Gaya. 
Fachschaft will provide room, the Fachschaft advertisment channel may be used for the workshop. 

Feedback by Gaya: he feels not very supported by the Fachschaft, which surprised/disappoints him, as he thought the Fachschaft is there
to support people
Feedback from Bo: admit that there was a certain biased for the workshop
Feedback from Paula: strong (!) disagreement that the "position of the Fachschaft" was not firstly discussed and democraticly voted in the meeting before. 
The "position of the Fachschaft" arose with a private talk of 3 poeple. 
Furthermore: as the Fachschaft doesn't seem to hurt any priciples of democracy, peace and is not conspiracy, Paula sees no right in rejecting the workshop, just because it doesn't "feel" good (which was earlier "position of Fachschaft") 
Materials the Fachschaft provides: 
theoratically whiteboard and pinboard which is yet both not hung up. 
Gaya tells the date to Fachschaft and if he wants creates advertisement.
