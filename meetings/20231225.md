## Meeting

**Present: Erik, John, Nicolai, Paula, Rofa√Øda**

## John Stepping Back

- John will be focussing more on academic events of the Fachschaft. Thank you so much for all the work you put in! ü§ó

## Fachschaft Changing
- Paula suggesting a 'Zukunftswerkschaft' for the next year to see about the direction the Fachschaft should take
- bifurcation between more technically-minded and social people: how do we bridge that gap?

## Gl√ºhweintopf

- the Gl√ºhweintopf continues to be lost, BBP suggestion is to pay for the new Skandi one using our Fachschaftsfunds which seems more than fair. Should the lost one reappear, we can keep one of them

## Events for the new year

- ice skating in Reutlingen sometime in January
- hike again once it gets warm
- BBQ sometime once it gets warm

## Short Opinion Round

- John: ideally a more leadership focussed person, more people putting in  effort, addressing the democracy deficit
- Nicolai: more people putting in effort, Fachschaft exists to aid people in their studies and help introduce people to one another
- Erik: more technical events, more structure‚Äîmight be hard without more clearly defined membership
- Rofa√Øda: Fachschaft doesn't need a mission, need to find a balance between friends meeting and achieving our goals, more people putting effort
- Paula: does the Fachschaft have a mission? Lack of a culture of discussion

## Moving Meeting Time Again?

- move meetings back to Tuesday?
- another poll to move meetings
